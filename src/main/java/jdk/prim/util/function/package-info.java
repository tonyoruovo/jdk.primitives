/**
 * Provides enhanced functional interfaces for primitive and generic types.
 * <p>
 * The {@code mathaid.calculator.base.util.function} package extends the
 * capabilities of the standard {@code java.util.function} package by offering
 * specialized functional interfaces that handle both primitive data types and
 * generic types. This package is designed to complement the existing Java
 * functional interfaces by adhering to Java naming conventions and providing
 * direct support for primitive types, thereby reducing the need for autoboxing
 * and unboxing which can impact performance.
 * <p>
 * Overview:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Enhanced support for primitive types to avoid performance penalties
 * associated with autoboxing.</li>
 * <li>Interfaces that mirror those in {@code java.util.function} but are
 * tailored for direct operations on primitive types.</li>
 * <li>Generic interfaces that extend the usability of Java's functional
 * programming capabilities.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Description:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link mathaid.calculator.base.util.function.Int}: Specialized for
 * operations with the primitive type {@code int}.</li>
 * <li>{@link mathaid.calculator.base.util.function.Long}: Specialized for
 * operations with the primitive type {@code long}.</li>
 * <li>{@link mathaid.calculator.base.util.function.Double}: Specialized for
 * operations with the primitive type {@code double}.</li>
 * <li>{@link mathaid.calculator.base.util.function.Float}: Specialized for
 * operations with the primitive type {@code float}.</li>
 * <li>{@link mathaid.calculator.base.util.function.Char}: Specialized for
 * operations with the primitive type {@code char}.</li>
 * <li>{@link mathaid.calculator.base.util.function.Short}: Specialized for
 * operations with the primitive type {@code short}.</li>
 * <li>{@link mathaid.calculator.base.util.function.Byte}: Specialized for
 * operations with the primitive type {@code byte}.</li>
 * <li>{@link mathaid.calculator.base.util.function.Boolean}: Specialized for
 * operations with the primitive type {@code boolean}.</li>
 * <li>{@link mathaid.calculator.base.util.function.Obj}: Provides interfaces
 * for operations involving generic types.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Real-world scenarios:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Performing mathematical and scientific computations where direct
 * operations on primitive types can enhance performance.</li>
 * <li>Building high-performance data processing applications where minimizing
 * overhead is crucial.</li>
 * <li>Developing systems where memory efficiency is critical, such as in
 * embedded systems or low-resource environments.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * // Using Int.BiFunction to add two integers
 * Int.BiFunction.AndInt<Integer> addIntegers = (x, y) -> x + y;
 * System.out.println(addIntegers.applyInt(5, 3)); // Output will be 8
 *
 * // Using Double.Function to compute the cosine of a double
 * Double.Function.OfDouble cosineFunction = Math::cos;
 * System.out.println(cosineFunction.applyDouble(Math.PI)); // Output will be -1.0
 *
 * // Using Obj.BiFunction to merge two strings
 * Obj.BiFunction<String, String, String> concatenate = (s1, s2) -> s1 + s2;
 * System.out.println(concatenate.apply("Hello, ", "world!")); // Output will be "Hello, world!"
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * These interfaces are intended to complement, not replace, the standard
 * interfaces provided in {@code java.util.function}, by providing full
 * primitive support and adhering to Java's naming conventions to enhance
 * readability and performance in Java functional programming.
